                    <h3 class="headeralign">Brazil’s Atlantic forest: putting the pieces back together</h3>
                    <p>Surrounded by a sea of cattle ranches and sugarcane plantations, a few ‘islands’ of Atlantic Forest remain. By establishing a private reserve and working with local people to connect forest fragments, SAVE Brasil is showing that it is possible to turn the tide on extinction.
                    </p>
                    <p>"I can pinpoint the location where the last ever Alagoas Foliage-gleaner was seen”, says Pedro Develey, Director of SAVE Brasil (BirdLife Partner). “The bird was in a tangle of lianas, mid-story level, close to the edge of the forest. It was possible to see some plantations invading the protected forest. That sighting in 2011 was very short, just a quick view of this very rare bird. But I never imagined at the time that it would be one of last records of the species in the wild. Now it is on the brink of being declared officially extinct.”

                            The Atlantic Forest was once a great continuous swathe of green, but was rapidly cleared and most forest converted into sugarcane plantations and cities, leaving only patches of forest scattered along the east coast of South America. Just 2% of the Atlantic Forest remains in north-eastern Brazil. These forest islands are now final refuges for bird species with global populations of just tens of adult birds.</p>

                    <p>A new study shows that the USA and Canada have lost more than a quarter of their birds over the past 50 years. This massive reduction in abundance involves hundreds of species, from beloved backyard songbirds to long-distance migrants. So what’s going on?</p>
                    <p>Can you imagine waking up to a world without birdsong? Or looking out on your garden to find it completely empty of birds? New research shows that, unless we act fast, this terrible future may not be too far off. A study published today in the journal Science reveals that since 1970, bird populations in the United States and Canada have declined by 29 percent, or almost 3 billion birds. The results show tremendous losses across diverse groups of birds and habitats – from iconic songbirds such as meadowlarks to long-distance migrants such as swallows, as well as backyard birds including sparrows</p>
